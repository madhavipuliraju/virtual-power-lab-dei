* Objective
  - To Simulate the “To determine positive sequence, negative sequence and zero sequence reactances of an alternator” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/virtual-power-lab-dei/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/To determine positive sequence, negative sequence and zero sequence reactances of an alternator/To determine positive sequence, negative sequence and zero sequence reactances of an alternator_01_Usability_smk.org][To determine positive sequence, negative sequence and zero sequence reactances of an alternator_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the Simulation page
  3. Click on Open circuit test in Determination of Positive Sequence Reactance (X1 = E/Isc)
  4. Now decrease and increase the resistance values

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk character
  3. A new page should be opened with the Simulation Process.
  4. As the resistance value changes , corresponding graph should be displayed on the screen.

* Review/comments
