* Objective
  - To Simulate the “ToTo determine the direct axis reactance (Xd) and quadrature axis reactance (Xq) of synchronous machine” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/virtual-power-lab-dei/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/ determine the direct axis reactance (Xd) and quadrature axis reactance (Xq) of synchronous machine/ determine the direct axis reactance (Xd) and quadrature axis reactance (Xq) of synchronous machine_01_Usability_smk.org][ determine the direct axis reactance (Xd) and quadrature axis reactance (Xq) of synchronous machine_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the Simulation page
  3. Click on Simulation for Xd and Xq .
  4. Set valid 'Max Angle' in Variation in Self Inductance with angle,Variation in Mutual Inductance with angle and Armature Current and then select the phase 2

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk character
  3. The result should be displayed on the screen in the form of graphs in all the three tables.
  4. The colour of the graph should be yellow

* Review/comments
